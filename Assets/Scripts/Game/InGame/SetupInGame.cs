         * Things to do:
         *
         * x Disable whatever menu behaviors. Maintain a back button with additional RPC calls?
         * --- Need to make RelayUtpClient not an MB so I can freely disable the menus? It is on the GameManager, as it happens, but...
         * x Spawn the object with the NetworkManager and allow that to connect.
         * - Wait for all players to connect, or boot a player after a few seconds (via Relay) if they did not connect.
         * x While waiting, server selects the target sequence, spawns the symbol container, and starts pooling/spawning the symbol objects.
         * - Once all players are in, show the target sequence and instructions, and then the server starts moving the symbol container and listening to click events.
         * - After the symbols are all passed (I guess tracking the symbol container position or a timeout), finish the game (set the winner flag).
         * x Clients clean up and return to the lobby screen. Host sets the lobby back to the regular state.
